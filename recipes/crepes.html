    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with 
    a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. 
    The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a 
            large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and 
            whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over
            medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto 
            the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. 
            Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the 
            batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet 
            and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen 
            the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has 
            turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
